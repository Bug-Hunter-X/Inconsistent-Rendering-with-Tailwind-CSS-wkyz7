# Inconsistent Rendering with Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS. The bug causes inconsistent rendering behavior across different browsers or screen sizes.

## Bug Description
The main issue is that the simple component renders correctly in some environments, but not others.  Debugging showed that the `flex`, `items-center`, and `justify-center` classes aren't working as expected across all tested browsers/screen sizes. 

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and inspect the rendering.
3. Resize the browser window to observe behavior across different screen sizes.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the correct inclusion of Tailwind's CSS file, double-checking the class names for typos and updating to the latest version of Tailwind. In some cases, using more specific utility classes might resolve the problem.
